Project Summary
This project was developed for Airgead Banking to help teach high school students about fiscal responsibility, with a focus on investing and the concept of compound interest. The application allows users to see how their investments can grow over time, aiming to instill a solid understanding of smart saving and investing habits early on.

Reflections on My Work
What I Did Well

I effectively understood and implemented the functional requirements provided by Airgead Banking.
I designed an interactive tool that is both engaging and educational for students.
I implemented the compound interest calculations accurately and efficiently, which are central to the app's functionality.
Areas for Enhancement

User Interface Improvements: Making the user interface more interactive could improve user engagement and ease of use.
Code Optimization: There are opportunities to streamline the code to enhance performance.
Security Enhancements: Implementing stronger security measures would protect any user data handled by the application.
Challenges Faced

The compound interest calculation was complex, especially considering different compounding intervals and user inputs. I overcame this by thoroughly testing the logic under various scenarios.
Ensuring robust data validation was necessary to handle user inputs safely and correctly.
Adhering to best coding practices required meticulous attention to detail but was crucial for maintainability and security.
Skills Gained

The object-oriented programming skills I honed are broadly applicable to many software development projects.
Gaining a deeper understanding of financial calculations like compound interest will be useful in any finance-related development tasks.
Project management skills developed through this project, from planning to implementation, are valuable for any future projects.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I used in-line comments to clarify the purpose of code blocks, which will assist anyone who works on this project in the future.
I designed the application in a modular way, which enhances readability and makes the codebase easier to update or modify.
By adhering to established coding standards, I ensured the code was secure, efficient, and maintainable.
